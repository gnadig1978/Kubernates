Kubernetes  is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
In other words, you can cluster together groups of hosts running Linux® containers, and Kubernetes helps you easily and efficiently manage those clusters.


There are two kinds of Nodes:

Master Node: It’s the control center that manages the deployed resources. Some of its components are kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, kublet.

Worker Nodes: Machines where the actual Containers are running on. Some of the active processes are kublet service, container runtime ( like Docker ), kube-proxy service.

kube-apiserver :


kube-scheduler : 


kube-controller-manager :
